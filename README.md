# Next.JS Starter

This is a highly opinionated starter project for your next Next.js project. It's full of utility functions, helpful libraries, and a component system heavily based on [IBM's Carbon design system](https://carbondesignsystem.com/) that I came up with when creating [Leadgeek](https://leadgeek.io) v2. Really, it's just set up with the technologies I enjoy using, and I hope you do too.

The intended tech stack is as follows:

- Next.JS w/ TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Supabase for auth + databasing
- Stripe for payments
- SendGrid/Twilio for email/SMS
- Vitest/Playwright for unit/e2e testing
- Vercel for deployment

This starter features a markdown blog, dynamic Open Graph images, error monitoring w/ Sentry, Github Actions CI/CD, light/dark mode, and more...
